## Scenario
> Spotlight is a MAC OS image forensics challenge where you can evaluate your DFIR skills against an OS you usually encounter in today's case investigations.

## Tools Used
    •Mac_apt
        ◦ DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) tool to process Mac computer full disk images (or live machines) and extract data/metadata useful for forensic investigation.
    •DB Browser for SQLite
        ◦ DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.
    •Steghide
        ◦ Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical tests.     
    •Plist Explorer
        ◦ This tool may be used to parse the data content of a .plist file.
    • FSEventsParser
        ◦ FSEventsParser can be used to parse FSEvents files from the '/.fseventsd/' on a live system or FSEvents files extracted from an image.
